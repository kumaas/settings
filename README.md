Bash
----
  1. **For MacOS**  
    - Paste this into your |home|/.bash_profile file:  
      ```bash
        export SETTINGS_DIR='|Full_path_to_where_you_cloned_this_repo|'
        alias soal='source ~/.bash_profile'

        export CURR_PWD=$PWD
        echo $SETTINGS_DIR > "$SETTINGS_DIR/address"

        cd "$SETTINGS_DIR/bash" # where settings are located
        for file in `\find default/rc custom/rc -name .*rc`; do source $file; done;
        PS1=`cat default/util/prompt`
        cd $CURR_PWD
        ```

  2. **For Linux**  
    - Paste this into your |home|/.bashrc:  
      ```bash
      export SETTINGS_DIR='|Full_path_to_where_you_cloned_this_repo|'
      alias soal='source ~/.bashrc'

      export CURR_PWD=$PWD
      echo $SETTINGS_DIR > "$SETTINGS_DIR/address"

      cd "$SETTINGS_DIR/bash" # where settings are located
      for file in `\find default/rc custom/rc -name .*rc`; do source $file; done;
      PS1=`cat default/util/prompt`
      cd $CURR_PWD
      ```

  3. **Customization**  
    - Add your own `.rc` files inside bash directory which will include your own new aliases. They all will be sourced through `soal` command, that is newly installed as an alias.
